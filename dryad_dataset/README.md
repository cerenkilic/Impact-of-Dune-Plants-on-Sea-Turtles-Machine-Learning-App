# Case study data 2022: The effects of dune plant roots on loggerhead turtle (*Caretta caretta*) nest success

## General Information

The raw data presented in Redding et al. (2024) are included. This study aimed to understand the impact of dune plant roots on the eggs of threatened loggerhead sea turtles. Data per nest, including zone number, location, distance to the dune and the high water mark (m), excavation date, nest chamber measurements (cm), vegetation and root presence, egg status counts, and hatch and emergence successes, are included in the file 'ReddingRootsCaseStudy22.csv'. Please review methods in Redding et al. (2024) for information on data collection.

Year Collected: 2022
Species: Loggerhead (*Caretta caretta*) sea turtles
Collection site: Casey Key, Florida (93 nests)
